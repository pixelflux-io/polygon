                        PixelFlux allows you to claim ownership over pixel layers.
                        If you own the topmost layer of a pixel, you can customize its color.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While your ownership of a layer is permanent, others can purchase a new layer on top of yours. 
                        When this happens, the payment for the new layer is distributed among all existing layer owners of that pixel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each time a layer is added, the pixel's value increases by its base price. 
                        It's possible to buy several layers at once.
                    </p>

                        Dive in by clicking on a pixel to explore its attributes.
